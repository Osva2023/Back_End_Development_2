Relational Databases:

Structure: They use a tabular data model with tables containing rows and columns.
Fixed Schema: The database structure is defined by a fixed schema that specifies the relationships between tables.
Query Language: Structured Query Language (SQL) is used for operations and queries.
Vertical Scalability: To scale, it usually involves increasing hardware capacity (e.g., adding more processing power or memory to a server).
Document Databases:

Structure: Data is stored in document format (such as JSON or BSON), which can contain structured or unstructured information.
Dynamic Schema: There is no fixed schema, allowing documents with different structures in the same database.
Query Language: Document-based queries are used, often integrating with programming languages (e.g., MongoDB uses JSON-based document queries).
Horizontal Scalability: They are often better suited for horizontal scalability, distributing data across multiple servers to handle large volumes of 
information.

General Considerations:

Flexibility: Document databases are more flexible in terms of schema, making them ideal for situations where data requirements may change over time.
Performance: Document databases can be more efficient for certain types of queries and operations due to their document-based structure.
Use Cases: Relational databases are commonly used in applications requiring complex transactions and defined relationships, while document databases are popular in environments where data structure may vary, and greater flexibility is needed.



About MongoDB
Data Model:

Document-Oriented: MongoDB stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) documents, which are binary representations of JSON documents. 
These documents can contain structured or unstructured data.

Structure and Schema:

Dynamic Schema: It does not have a fixed schema, meaning different documents in the same collection can have different structures. 
This provides flexibility to change the data structure without modifying a predefined schema.

Query Language:

Document-Based Query: MongoDB uses document-based queries that resemble JSON syntax. 
This makes it easy to search and manipulate data, especially for developers familiar with JSON format.

Scalability:

Horizontal Scalability: MongoDB is known for its horizontal scalability, allowing you to distribute data across multiple 
servers to handle large volumes of information and improve performance.

Indexes:

Index Support: MongoDB allows the creation of indexes to enhance query performance. 
You can create indexes on one or multiple fields to accelerate data retrieval.

Transactions:

Transaction Support: In more recent versions, MongoDB has introduced support for transactions, enabling atomic operations across multiple documents.

Agile Development Usage:

Suitable for Agile Development: MongoDB is popular in agile development environments due to its flexibility and ease of adaptation to changes 
in data requirements.

Community and Ecosystem:

Wide Community and Ecosystem: MongoDB has an active community of users and developers. 
It also offers a variety of complementary tools and services, such as MongoDB Atlas for cloud management.

Use Cases:

Web, Mobile, and Enterprise Applications: MongoDB is used in a wide range of applications, 
including those requiring flexibility in data structure, such as web, mobile, and enterprise systems.

License:

Open Source License: MongoDB is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL).
